# SmartMerchantAdvance

A machine learning + optimization pipeline that simulates a real-world solution for automating merchant loan offerings, inspired by a deployed fintech system used at scale.

## 📌 Project Overview

SmartMerchantAdvance is an open-source replica of a real-world AI system designed to predict merchant processing volumes and generate optimized loan offers. It mimics a production-grade solution originally built at Moneris, adapted for public demonstration using simulated data.

## 💡 Business Problem

Merchants often need short-term financing. By predicting their future transaction volumes, we can proactively offer optimized cash advances tailored to their capacity and risk profile—maximizing both acceptance and profitability.

## 🧠 Methodology

- **Forecasting**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model predicts 12 months of future processing volume.
- **Optimization**: A nonlinear mixed-integer model (solved via Gurobi) determines the optimal loan amount, term, and pricing for each merchant.
- **Integration**: Forecast results feed directly into the optimization engine.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch (CNN)
- Gurobi Optimizer
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SmartMerchantAdvance.git
cd SmartMerchantAdvance
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run a basic simulation pipeline:
```bash
python src/run_pipeline.py
```

## 📊 Demo (Coming Soon)

We will soon add a Streamlit-based dashboard for interactive forecasting and optimization tuning.
